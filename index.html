    I am <i>Spencer T. Pudiquet</i>. Most of my friends call me Pencing, Pence and Penpen. I'm from Brgy. 1 San Nicolas Ilocos Norte. I'm currently a student pursuing <mark>Bachelor of Science Industrial Technology Major in Computer Technology</mark> at <mark>Mariano Marcos State University</mark>. I am <mark>20 years </mark>20 old and turning 21 on October 14. I'm really passionate about <mark>Music, Instruments and Anime</mark>. When I'm not buried in textbooks or working on assignments, you'll often find me playing my guitar, listening to music or watching anime. It's a great way for me to <mark>unwind and recharge</mark>. My dream when I was in highschool is to perform in the biggest music festival here in Ilocos Norte which is <mark>HIMALA SA BUHANGIN</mark>, and luckily me and my bandmates were invited to perform on that event last <mark>May 13,2023</mark>. All I ever wanted when I was a kid is to be a great musician so that I can make my <mark>Pops proud</mark>. It is an honor to introduce to you a musician who embodies the very essence of what it means to speak to the <i>heart through music</i>.
